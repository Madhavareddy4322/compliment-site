💖 Interactive Compliment Generator Web Application
📌 Project Description

The Interactive Compliment Generator Web Application is a modern, user-centric web app built using Next.js (React) that generates personalized compliments based on the user’s name and mood.

Unlike basic static compliment sites, this application focuses on interactivity, personalization, and real frontend logic, making it suitable for academic projects, portfolio demonstrations, and interviews.

The application dynamically generates non-repeating compliments, supports text-to-speech, and allows users to copy compliments for sharing.

🎯 Objectives

To build an interactive React-based web application

To demonstrate state management and conditional rendering

To improve user experience through personalization

To use modern browser APIs for real-world functionality

To move beyond static UI into logic-driven frontend development
